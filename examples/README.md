### pre-computed model grids

- [Coelho library](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005A%26A...443..735C/abstract) 300-1800nm

- To compute a custom grid using [iSpec](https://www.blancocuaresma.com/s/iSpec), check ispec_synthetic_grid.ipynb

  

### grid files for jaxspec

- make_grid_ispec.py or make_grid_coelho.py turn those grids into the format compatible with jaxspec 
- directory containing the pre-computed models & wavelength ranges need to be specified
- wavranges_ird_h.csv: IRD H-band
- wavranges_gaoes-rv.csv: GAOES-RV
